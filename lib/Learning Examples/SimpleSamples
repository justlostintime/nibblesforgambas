' an array remember array numbers start at zero
'Unfortunatly you can not define an embeded array in a simple script
'ie dim b[25] as string
'so this is how we have to do it

Dim B As String[] = New String[]
B.add("This value")
Print B[0], B[0][0] 

' the last will print first character

'This is how you must do an embedded array. Copy this and paste into new editor page
'then run it. You must define your own main proc to force it to be allowed
'this will not work with run selected. Embeded Arrays appear to have to be global
