' how to define and use classes in script
' The following is an example of using classes 
Dim b As Apples = New Apples

Print " hello"

' Start the class definition
Class Apples

   Public theMess As String = " hello too"

    Public Sub mess()
       Print themess
   ''DEBUG  " this is in a class"
    End
    ' add more methods etc here
End class

'More code after the class def
b.mess()

' as can be seen you may define classes anywhere in the file between statements etc
' remeber that you may not Dim anything in the class definistion it must be public or static
' class definitions are collected and then processed before the regular code in the file
